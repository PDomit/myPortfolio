          I’m an ambitious and persistent engineer who
          always follows through on goals. I do love
          electronics. I’m driven by a strong desire to learn
          and improve, and I find great satisfaction in
          creating something usefull. I have a solid
          understanding of electronics and circuit design,
          which allows me to take a full-stack approach to
          embedded systems – from hardware to firmware.
          A solid understanding of the basics makes
          learning new things much easier. I am very
          creative and I like solving problems. I can work in
          a team as well as on my own.  I'm looking for a job
          which offers me growth.

          <p class="AllText_Paragraph">
            I designed and built a device for testing tightness of the mechatronics of the DSG DQ200 dual-clutch transmission gearbox. 
            The project involved both hardware and software development from scratch. The device is controlled from a PC application created by me and fully controls operation of the mechatronics. 
            The application window is quite simple to use. It has buttons to change valves positions or to start the hydraulic pump. This device helps in detecting faults. A common fault in this mechatronics unit
            is the loss of pressure too fast because of a crack in the mechatronic's body. The device helps to find out if a mechatronics has a crack or not. This project cosists of several main parts which required different knowledge and skills.

              <p class="AllText_Paragraph">
                The principle is to start the hydraulic pump by clicking a button in the application window. The pressure rises. When the pressure reaches the appropriate level the pump stops. The device 
                is connected to mechatronic's pressure sensor and measure the pressure every second. When the pressure falls below the minimum level the pump starts again and 
                the time interval between stopping and starting the pump is shown in the application window. This time interval helps to detect if the pressure drops too quickly. The procedure can be 
                repeated after changing the position of the valves for example when changing gears. The photo on the left was taken while testing the pump in the friendly workshop where I have worked
                and where I was allowed to test my device.

                The electrical circuits was designed from scratch in order to controll solenoids and the bldc motor. The objective was to design circuits capable of handling up to 30A current and that could be controlled by STM32 microcontroller.
                The BLDC motors used in those mecahtronics don't have Hall sensors so I had to design circuits which could conduct commutation based on the back emf. The phase voltages had to be measured and filtered to finally provide the information
                abut the rotor position. I did not have opportunity to obtain PCB so I soldered it together using a universal board.

                The most challenging stage was creating bldc controller. This BLDC motor is quite different than most of bldc motors because it has the delta connection inside. I have been dealing with
                how to make the motor work in closed loop for a while but finally I succeeded. I have never created any Windows application before so I have started learning C# and quickly developed the application.
                This project gave me a great deal of experience with hardware, firmware and some soft skills such as work organising, documentation. I discovered that writing my thoughts and drawing helps me solve problems
                more effectively.

            The memory management system is capable of performing all memory operations on a serial access memory M93C46 with the MICROWIRE™ standard. Currently it can be used with the M93C46 or any memory with the same instruction set.
            It was designed to write, read, erase data to/from the memory chip. All operations are carried out using UART terminal on a PC. To perform an operation user have to enter appropriate two letters code, data if necessary and accept it by clicking 'Enter' button.
            A memory are suppsoed to be in x8 bit organization. 
            The system is able to cooperate with any serial memory but the instruction set must be adjusted depending on the memory chip used. 
            In the future it will be extended to simplify the process of selecting instruction sets based on used memory.

                The clarity of the code was crucial here. One small mistake in the order of bits sent to the memory chip could ruin the entire transmission or cause a difficult-to-find problem. I had one and found it while 
                well planned debugging. It was necessary to keep the code easily understandable and clarify because I shared the code. I have learnt some quite simple but really important skills such as naming variables 
                understandable, writing short but accurate comments and just making the code easy for the others. The scope has been used extensively to ensure that bits are sent in the correct order.
