            I designed and built a device for testing tightness of the mechatronics of the DSG DQ200 dual-clutch transmission gearbox. 
            The project involved both hardware and software development from scratch. The device is controlled from a PC application created by me and fully controls operation of the mechatronics. 
            The application window is quite simple to use. It has buttons to change valves positions or to start the hydraulic pump. This device helps in detecting faults. A common fault in this mechatronics unit
            is the loss of pressure too fast because of a crack in the mechatronic's body. The device helps to find out if a mechatronics has a crack or not. This project cosists of several main parts which required different knowledge and skills.

              <p class="AllText_Paragraph">
                The principle is to start the hydraulic pump by clicking a button in the application window. The pressure rises. When the pressure reaches the appropriate level the pump stops. The device 
                is connected to mechatronic's pressure sensor and measure the pressure every second. When the pressure falls below the minimum level the pump starts again and 
                the time interval between stopping and starting the pump is shown in the application window. This time interval helps to detect if the pressure drops too quickly. The procedure can be 
                repeated after changing the position of the valves for example when changing gears.

                The electrical circuits was designed from scratch in order to controll solenoids and the BLDC motor. The objective was to design circuits capable of handling up to 20A current and that could be controlled by STM32 microcontroller.
                The BLDC motors used in those mechatronics don't have Hall sensors so I had to design circuits which could conduct commutation based on the back-EMF. The phase voltages had to be measured and filtered to finally provide the information
                about the rotor position. I soldered it together using a universal board.

            The memory management system is capable of performing all memory operations on a serial access memory M93C46 with the MICROWIRE™ standard. Currently it can be used with the M93C46 or any memory with the same instruction set.
            It was designed to write, read, erase data to/from the memory chip. All operations are carried out using UART terminal on a PC. To perform an operation user have to enter appropriate two letters code, data if necessary and accept it by clicking 'Enter' button.
            A memory are suppsoed to be in x8 bit organization. 
            The system is able to cooperate with any serial memory but the instruction set must be adjusted depending on the memory chip used. 
            In the future it will be extended to simplify the process of selecting instruction sets based on used memory.

                The clarity of the code was crucial here. One small mistake in the order of bits sent to the memory chip could ruin the entire transmission or cause a difficult-to-find problem. I had one and found it while 
                well planned debugging. It was necessary to keep the code easily understandable and clarify because I shared the code. I have learnt some quite simple but really important skills such as naming variables 
                understandable, writing short but accurate comments and just making the code easy for the others. The scope has been used extensively to ensure that bits are sent in the correct order.

                The function was written in assembly for the ARMv7 architecture. For now the function does not support denormalized numbers so the minimal number the function returns is 2^(-126). 
                The code is avaible on my GitHub.

                In order to test the algorithm I created a script in Python. The script sends numbers to a MCU with the Cortex M4 via UART and the MCU returns a result of multiplication.
                Then the script checks if the result is correct. Wrong results are counted and printed.

                It was a challenging task but also intresting because of bare metal programming. Challenging part was how to create as optimised code as it was possible and to check all conditions like for example
                passing NaN value, or inf. Testing a code using Python was extremely helpful. The script has checked many options and returned wrong calculations so I was able to 
                fix it.
